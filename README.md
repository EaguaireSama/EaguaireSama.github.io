This is a portfolio of my Data Science projects. Most of the notebooks 
### Standalone projects
---------------------------------------------------------------------
### Handwritten Number Recognizer
This is one of my favorite projects. In this, I worked on the MNIST dataset and built classifiers using **different** methods.

1.  ### Desktop application - using NN (Octave)
> This was my first end to end project. I used the Octave skills I learnt from Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, to build a Neural Network and developed a Desktop app around it using PyQt5.
1.  ### Desktop application - using Keras [.ipynb](https://github.com/EaguaireSama/EaguaireSama.github.io/blob/main/NoteBooks/MNIST_classifier.ipynb)
> This is a slight modification to my previous project. Instead of using my own model, I used the Keras library to build a better Classifier.
